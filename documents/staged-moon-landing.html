      <h2 class="lead">…But it’s made in a Hollywood Basement</h2>
    </header>
    <p>These words, made famous in the 1999 hit song "Californication" by the Red Hot Chili Peppers, insinuate the overall image that everything in Hollywood is fake or manufactured. The whole song echoes this sentiment but I find it interesting that they included a reference about the idea of space being manufactured, or rather created, in Hollywood studios. Let me now transition. I, for as long as I can remember, have been infatuated with the idea of Space. More specifically, with our Moon. Our Moon has been at the center of everyone’s attention since the beginning of man. Man ultimately conquered the moon in July of 1969 when Neil Armstrong became the first human to set foot on its surface. His words "One small step for man, one giant leap for mankind" echoed across the globe, as it not only was an accomplishment for the United States but for mankind as a whole. Or was it?</p>
    <p>Let me take you back to the early 60s and the great "space race" that then president John F. Kennedy embarked the United States on. In the early 1960’s The United States and Soviet Union, coming of their victory as Allies over Germany and Japan in World War II, were the two main political, economic, and military world powers post war. The Cold War was at its pinnacle, Communism was rapidly spreading across the globe, and the USSR was leading the charge. When JFK became president in January 1961, one of his main domestic initiatives was to increase funding to NASA with an end mission that we would be on the moon by the end of the decade. JFK of course was assassinated nearly three years later and never saw Neil Armstrong set foot on the Moon.</p>
    <p>This background sets the stage in my overall theory that the United States or mankind never set foot on the moon in 1969. The landing and footage of the event was all created in a studio or "Hollywood basement" if you will. Many conspiracies have been thrown out there since the event occurred but I wanted to focus on two very simple explanations neither of which are scientific, I might add. First, the space race between the Soviet Union and the United States created intense competition as to which nation would get there first. As explained above with the Space Race the U.S. wanted to win and cement itself as THE world power and the best way to do that was to beat them to the moon. My other reason, again simple, is due to the current setting of sharply decreasing support for the Vietnam War. The United States government felt there was a need for the American people to get a "Win" and get their minds focused off the war. 1969 itself was a year to forget if you talk to any Americans that lived through it. Race riots were prevalent and anger over the Vietnam War was inciting violence all over the United States. Many historian’s claim that this was the most torn apart Americans had been since the Civil War, over 100 years earlier. One thing governments and the media does to turn people’s attention away from a sore subject is to create a false narrative or even create an event out of thin air. This is what I think the U.S did with the Moon landing. Yes, NASA was working on putting a man on the moon and yes, there was public funding to support that effort. However, the mounting pressure of trying to beat the Soviet Union and the overwhelming distaste the American people felt toward the government due to the Vietnam War, created the need for the U.S. to put a man on the moon in 1969.</p>
    <p>Authors Note: I am under the belief that the U.S. eventually sent astronauts to the moon but did not in 1969. When, I couldn’t tell ya, just think it happened at some point.</p>
